Final Thoughts

I made this to thank all the Tech Fellows and codepath graders who assisted me throughout my time in the program.
While my app still needs some work I am proud of what I am turning in and will continue to work on this in the foreseeable future.
This was a personal project that promoted a ton of growth in myself, I had thoughts on withdrawing from this course 
several times because I did suffer from imposter syndrome feeling that the curriculm was not for me and that I did not
belong here. I am thankful and grateful that I stayed and will continue to work on my confidences, thank you codepaths!
