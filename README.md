### Overview
#### Description
As part of my final project, I have decided to create a memory matching game, where the users must match symbols to be awarded points. 
The users should have the ability to click between tab features that will toggle different game codes, switching from sports, looking at previous scores,etc.
A stretch feature of a countdown timer may be added, as well as different game modes such as sports symbols, nfl players, nba players, etc.


#### App Evaluation
**Mobile**: There are many matching games, this one can be used on your phone. 
**Category**: health/entertainment. Memory games have been said to help with cognition so it will be a healthy and fun game. 
**Story**: Valuable app, it would be enjoyed I feel based on different game modes.
**Market**: Intend to target sports fans, but anyone who loves a compelling matching game will be interested. Audience may vary from adults to children. 
**Habit**: I would see the app as addictive, if timing and scores are incorporated users will try to break their score every chance they get. Consume app. 
**Scope**: If stretch features are incorporated the app will be difficult so I am still iffy on if I will use them. Very defined to build.
