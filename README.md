### Overview
#### Description
As part of my final project, I have decided to create a memory matching game, where the users must match symbols to be awarded points. 
The users should have the ability to click between tab features that will toggle different game codes, switching from sports, looking at previous scores,etc.
A stretch feature of a countdown timer may be added, as well as different game modes such as sports symbols, nfl players, nba players, etc.


#### App Evaluation
**Mobile**: There are many matching games, this one can be used on your phone. 
**Category**: health/entertainment. Memory games have been said to help with cognition so it will be a healthy and fun game. 
**Story**: Valuable app, it would be enjoyed I feel based on different game modes.
**Market**: Intend to target sports fans, but anyone who loves a compelling matching game will be interested. Audience may vary from adults to children. 
**Habit**: I would see the app as addictive, if timing and scores are incorporated users will try to break their score every chance they get. Consume app. 
**Scope**: If stretch features are incorporated the app will be difficult so I am still iffy on if I will use them. Very defined to build.


### Product Spec
#### 1. User Stories (Required and Optional)

- user can change between sports or imaging
- change the number of matches defaults to 6 matches (12 items)

#### 2. Screen Archetypes
**Start Screen**
- Allows the user to begin the memory matching game.

**Gameplay Screen**
- Includes the matching items allows user to play.

**End of Game Screen**

###Reflections

Sprint1
First week sprint. This week I incorporated the creation of my idea. The memory game as well as mapping and outline the project. I created a name for the project and the wireframe image. The beginning of the project is in place.

For this week I have prepped the code for the start up page.

  **UPDATE 11/11/2023
    Sprint2

For week 2, I changed a lot about my project and actually did a completely new design than I previously thought I would.
The sprints that I was able to complete within this week for Unit 9 were Sprint number 2 and sprint 3. I chose
to use team logos instead of the actual player. I left a easteregg of Lebron James as one of the possible matches.

The stretch functions are still in the works but the code runs fine and I can present what I have and then build on later.
So far I have completed the NBA portion of the code with limitations, there are usually 30 teams I chose to use a randomizer
to approximately 23 teams, so some of the favorite teams may be absent for now but updated later. The NFL and blend of the 
two are still in the works I did say changing settings would be a stretch function but it is visible as of now. You just do
not have the ability to affect the actual app. I also decided not to include the feature that will allow the player to view scores
because there is no longer a score tracker as I had previously. I dedicated to remove the score tracker in replace of a countdown
timer that ends the app run.

Sprints 1, 2, 3, 5, and portion of 4 is completed. The portion that is not complete is the stretch feature.
I have uploaded the code into my github respitory.
