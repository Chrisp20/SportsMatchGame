Sprints
**UPDATE 11/11/2023

Sprint1, completed
Sprint2, completed
Sprint3, completed
Sprint5, completed
Sprint4 (stretch feature), not completed

For week 2, I changed a lot about my project and actually did a completely new design than I previously thought I would.
The sprints that I was able to complete within this week for Unit 9 were Sprint number 2 and sprint 3. I chose
to use team logos instead of the actual player. I left a easteregg of Lebron James as one of the possible matches.

The stretch functions are still in the works but the code runs fine and I can present what I have and then build on later.
So far I have completed the NBA portion of the code with limitations, there are usually 30 teams I chose to use a randomizer
to approximately 23 teams, so some of the favorite teams may be absent for now but updated later. The NFL and blend of the 
two are still in the works I did say changing settings would be a stretch function but it is visible as of now. You just do
not have the ability to affect the actual app. I also decided not to include the feature that will allow the player to view scores
because there is no longer a score tracker as I had previously. I dedicated to remove the score tracker in replace of a countdown
timer that ends the app run.

Sprints 1, 2, 3, 5, and portion of 4 is completed. The portion that is not complete is the stretch feature.
I have uploaded the code into my github respitory.
