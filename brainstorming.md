Story: Valuable app, it would be enjoyed I feel based on different game modes
Market: Intend to target sports fans, but anyone who loves a compelling matching game will be interested. Audience may vary from adults to children.
Habit: I would see the app as addictive, if timing and scores are incorporated users will try to break their score every chance they get. Consume app.
Scope: If stretch features are incorporated the app will be difficult so I am still iffy on if I will use them. Very defined to build.

- TV show app, Mobile: Useful app for information.
Category: Social/entertainment
Story: valuable as a substitute to IMDB, but an app form as opposed to website.
Market: Size and scale are undefined but can range to millions of those interested in research their favorite shows.
Habit: This may be used rarely not as common as the other 2 apps.
