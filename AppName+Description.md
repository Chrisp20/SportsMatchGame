# Sports Match App (S.M.A.)

As part of my final project, I have decided to create a memory matching game, where the users must match symbols before the timer runs out. The required feature that I have put into place allows for NBA team logos to be selected, a countdown timer, in a landscape mode.

A stretch feature of different game modes will continue to be in the works no timely completion such as NFL teams, NFL players, and NBA players. As well as the completion of th settings. The settings will allow for user to decide whether they want to use NFL teams, NBA teams, a combination of the 2, and removing the timer. I also wanted to find a way to change the total number of matches that are allowed.
